	avocado, and lettuce :)</p>
	
	<p class="larger">What you'll need:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>1/4 cup neutral oil, like grapeseed or corn, plus a little more</li>
			<li>Four 5-inch corn tortillas</li>
			<li>1/4 cup refried beans, or any soft well-seasoned beans</li>
			<li>4 eggs</li>				
			<li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>1/2 cup salsa</li>
			<li>1/4 cup queso fresco or grated Monterey Jack or cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley for garnish</li>
		</ul>
	
	<p class="larger">What you'll do:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
			<li>Heat oil in a small skillet over medium heat. When hot, fry tortillas one at a time until softened
			and heated through, about 3 seconds per side. Make sure they do not crisp. Drain on paper towels.</li>
			<li>Spread 1 tablespoon of beans in center of each tortilla and set aside. (You can prepare this 
			dish to this point up to one hour in advance).</li>
			<li>Use a little more oil to fry eggs sunny side up, sprinkling salt and pepper while they cook to your liking.</li>
			<li>Put an egg in the center of each tortilla, then top with 2 tablespoons salsa and 1 tablespoon cheese.</li>
			<li>Carefully transfer tortillas to baking dish that holds them snugly.</li>
			<li>Bake until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately!</li>
